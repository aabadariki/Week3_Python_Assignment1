# Discount Calculator

This is a simple Python program that calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount.

- If the discount is 20% or higher, the program applies the discount.
- If the discount is less than 20%, the program returns the original price.

The program asks the user to enter:

- The original price of the item
- The discount percentage

It then prints out the final price.
